## Poc ArgoCD OVH

This project is a proof of concept that will be used to test at the same time the integration of **ArgoCD** with OVH Kubernetes Engine and the Public Cloud of OVH.

The goal of this project is to have a basic infrastructure (3 node) with a load balancer (MetalLB X Ovh) and a GitOps system (ArgoCD) that will deploy a simple stack.

The simple stack is composed of:

- An Ingress controller (Haproxy)
- A certificate manager (Cert-manager)
- A simple web application (Guestbook)
- An endpoint to acess either the Web app or the ArgoCD UI

The project is available on [Github](https://github.com/batleforc/poc-argocd-ovh)
